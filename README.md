<strong>Software Development Methodologies:</strong>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Agile</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pros:</li>
            <li>Cons:</li>
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Waterfall</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Waterfall Methodology is a sequential design process, this means that the stages are completed stage by stage. As the process is sequential, once the stage has been completed, it is difficult for developers to go back to a previous stage. Therefore, the project outcome must be clearly defined at the beginning of the project.</li></br>
            <li>
                Pros:
                <ol>
                    <li>The cilent knows what to expect, as they have a clear project outcome.</li>
                    <li>Simple and easy to understand.</li>
                    <li>Works well for small projects where requirements are well defined.</li>
                    <li>Clearly defined stages.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
    </br>
            <li>Cons:
                <ol>
                    <li>No working software is produced till late in the stages.</li>
                    <li>Cannot accommodate changing requirements.</li>
                    <li>Once a stage is completed, difficult for developers to go back to previous stages.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>When should you use Waterfall? 
                <ol>
                    <li>When there is a clear picture of the final product.</li>
                    <li>When the scope doesn't change during the project.</li>
                    <li>When a working product is not required immediately.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
