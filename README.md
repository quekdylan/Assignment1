<strong>Software Development Methodologies:</strong>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Agile</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The agile methodology is a iterative design process that builds software incrementally. It helps teams deliver value to their customers faster.</li></br>
            <li>
                Pros:
                <ol>
                    <li>Responsive to changes as new features can be developed in the upcoming sprint</li>
                    <li>Working product after first few sprints</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
    </br>
            <li>
                Cons:
                <ol>
                    <li>There is no clear picture of the final product</li>
                    <li>Requires adaptable skilled developers</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Waterfall</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Waterfall Methodology is a sequential design process, this means that the stages are completed stage by stage. As the process is sequential, once the stage has been completed, it is difficult for developers to go back to a previous stage. Therefore, the project outcome must be clearly defined at the beginning of the project.</li></br>
            <li>
                Pros:
                <ol>
                    <li>The cilent knows what to expect, as they have a clear project outcome.</li>
                    <li>Simple and easy to understand.</li>
                    <li>Works well for small projects where requirements are well defined.</li>
                    <li>Clearly defined stages.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
    </br>
            <li>Cons:
                <ol>
                    <li>No working software is produced till late in the stages.</li>
                    <li>Cannot accommodate changing requirements.</li>
                    <li>Once a stage is completed, difficult for developers to go back to previous stages.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>When should you use Waterfall? 
                <ol>
                    <li>When there is a clear picture of the final product.</li>
                    <li>When the scope doesn't change during the project.</li>
                    <li>When a working product is not required immediately.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Spiral</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Spiral Model is a combination of a waterfall model and iterative model. Each phase in spiral model begins with a design goal and ends with the client reviewing the progress
            </li>
            <li>Pros:
                <ol>
                    <li>Changing requirements can be accommodated</li>
                    <li>Users see the system early</li>
                    <li>Development can be divided into smaller parts and the risky parts can be developed earlier which helps in better risk management</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Cons:
                <ol>
                    <li>Management is more complex</li>
                    <li>Large number of intermediate stages requires excessive documentation</li>
                    <li>Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </br>
    <li><strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rapid Application Development is a development model that prioritizes rapid prototyping and receiving quick feedback based on the prototype and it has a drawn out development and testing cycle. Developers are able to make multiple iterations and updates to a software rapidly without having to start a development schedule with scratch each time.
            </li></br>
            <li>Pros:
                <ol>
                    <li>Requirements can be changed at any time</li>
                    <li>Feedbacks and reviews are quick</li>
                    <li>Higher customer satisfication, customer more confident as there's prototypes</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Cons:
                <ol>
                    <li>Needs highly skilled developers</li>
                    <li>Needs strong team collaboration</li>
                    <li>More complex to manage compared to other models</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>When should you use RAD? 
                <ol>
                    <li>When you can reliably test your prototypes</li>
                    <li>When you need a project done quickly</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            </br>
        </ul>
</ol>
